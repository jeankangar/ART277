        <h1>Travelling in Depression</h1>
        <p>
            When I was very little , I caught the travel bug.<br>
            It started after my grandparents first brought me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me a unique learning experience.
        </p>

        <img src="assignment_three_image/image_one.jpeg" alt="Girl" style="width: 150px; float: left; margin: 10px">
        <p style="clear: right; padding-top: 24px;">
            At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the city of lights.<br>
            When iI was eight, I stood in the heart of piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then gilded down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas.<br>
            At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of stonehenge and walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the thousand-year-old stone were still in place.<br>
            <br>
            It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language.<br>
        </p>
        <p style="clear: left">
            It began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation.I remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des Pyramids was. But when I pronounced it PYR-a-mides instead of pyr-A-mides, with more accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered.<br>
        <br>
            In the eight grade, I became fascinated with spanish and aware of its similarities with English through cognates.
            Baseball in Spanish, for example, is bolshie, which looks different but sound nearly the same. This was incredible to me as it made
            speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, in high school, developed an enthusiasm for chinese. As I studied Chinese at my school, I marveled how if justone stroke was missing
            from a character, the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were formed by combining simpler character, so Hub (火灾) meaning fire and shan (山)
            meaning mountain can be joined to create hòu-shān (霍山) which means  volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters, and I can
            feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.
        </p>
